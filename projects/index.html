        <h2>Bruin Actuarial Society Case Competition</h2>
        <article>
            <p>This case competition tasked myself along with my 3 fellow team members to conduct an insurance portfolio analysis for a realty company. 
                We were given data on the accident history for the estate assets held by this company. 
                Using this information we were able to run a Monte Carlo Simulation to conduct a stress test on each insurance option, 
                which allowed us to determine which option best satisfied our client's needs</p>
